# Modular Haxe JS with Webpack

This project demonstrates the creation of a Haxe-JavaScript modular project leveraging Webpack 
for bundling (code and assets) and lazy loading.

It's really easy and absolutely transparent in the code!

## How it works

### Leveraging Webpack features

You will need to get familiar with how Webpack works - thankfully the documentation
is excellent nowadays: [https://webpack.js.org/](https://webpack.js.org/)

A project aims at creating a Webpack loader for Haxe:
[https://github.com/jasononeil/webpack-haxe-loader](https://github.com/jasononeil/webpack-haxe-loader)

...
```

Even the HTML page is generated by a plugin, so everything has to go through Webpack.

### Haxe JS code splitting

Haxe JS isn't normally capable of code splitting, but the core functionality was 
developped within the (Webpack-free) Haxe Modular project:
[https://github.com/elsassph/haxe-modular](https://github.com/elsassph/haxe-modular)

The Haxe Webpack loader will leverage the code splitting feature when you request
modules asynchronously:

```haxe
import com.Foo;
...
// Extract Foo (and dependencies) into a separate bundle
Webpack.aync(Foo).then(function(_) {
	// Foo is now loaded
	var foo = new Foo();
});
```
